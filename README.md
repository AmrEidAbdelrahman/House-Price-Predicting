# House-Price-Predicting
Using ML we build a model to predict the price of a house based on saved data for other houses was for sale with houses attributes.
But the data was messy and we need to clean it first, using pandas we clean the missing values in the data and factorize the object data ( transfer object attributes into numbers )
after than, we checked the relation between the target attributes and other attributes.
